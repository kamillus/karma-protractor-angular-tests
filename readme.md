# Collection of Protractor/Jasmine scripts for Angular testing

This repo is a collection of tests I have developed for a production site. The tests have been modified for brevity and show various unit/functional testing approaches to testing Angularjs based apps, mainly:

  - The use of functional and unit testing
  - The use of spies
  - Mocking up requests
  - How to deal with dependancy injection
  - Various Jasmine testing statements (.toBe, toBeFalsy, etc..)

You can't really run this project, but you can certainly apply some of the patterns in your angular/js projects.

Enjoy!
